            <p>We started our business way back in June of 2020 when the Coronavirus was running loose and many were trapped at home with little to do!</p>
            <p>It was obvious that people needed something to keep their minds at work.</p>
            <p>Zack's Xylophones was created to get people exercising their musical talents! (Even when we really have very little ourselves, and honestly haven't touched a xylophone outside of retail stores...)</p>
